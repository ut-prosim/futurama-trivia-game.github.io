trivia game project using an API

i used some jQuery, vanilla javascript, CSS, an API and HTML.  

my approach was to connect to an API and use their questions and answers to populate my trivia game.  i set the game up to ask ten random questions from the API.  the possible answers in the possible answer array were made into buttons that one could choose one's answer from.  the selected button was compared against the stated correct answer in the API.  i created arrays of responses to give if a correct answer was selected and if an incorrect answer was selected.

the only thing i ran out of time to do that i had planned on doing was setting up an array that would keep track of the questions already asked so that they could not be asked again.
