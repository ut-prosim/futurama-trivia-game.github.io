trivia game project using an API

i used some jQuery, vanilla javascript, CSS, an API and HTML.  

my approach was to connect to an API and use their questions and answers to populate my trivia game.  i did not finish, however.  i had several unsolved problems due to time constraints.  i did not get the game functional with the questions and therefore the win/lose state.  i wanted to include more graphics, and there was a plan to create the API that powered my game.
